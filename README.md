# drumkit
This project was built in lieu of my continued endeavour to better learn JavaScript and the DOM. I used a JavaScript for loop to target button elements and add an event listener to each. The event listener fired off a function that on button click, a unique sound was played - using JavaScript's Audio object and the play() method. Inside of the event listener, I targeted the inner html for each button to use as the triggers for the switch statement I implemented - as opposed to using if statements. I later went in and made three changes to enable different drum sounds to be played when certain keys are pressed on a physical keyboard. Moved the switch statement into it's own function playSound(). I then passed this function into two other anonymous functions. One that is triggered by an on button click event listener, the second - an event listener on the document object that is triggered by a physical keyboard press - when the key pressed matches the character in any of our buttons' inner html.
