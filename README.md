# drumkit
This project was built in lieu of my continued endeavour to better learn JavaScript and the DOM. I used a JavaScript for loop to targt button elements and add an event listener to each. The event listener fired off a function that on button click, a unique sound was played - using JavaScript's Audio object and the play() method. Inside of the event listener, I targeted the inner html for each button to use as the triggers for the switch statement I implemented, - as opposed to if statements.
